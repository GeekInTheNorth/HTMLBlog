# HTMLBlog
I am creating a very basic blog using JSON and HTML.
I am hosting this on a Raspberry Pi running with a dyndns server.  I have hosted using wordpress on a Raspberry Pi before and the performance wasn't good.

TODO:
Implement an about page
Style the website so it looks nicer
Implement a Calendar of posts
Add more social media links
Add links to the websites of other developers

Done:
Implemented a dynamically drawn menu so article pages only need a target div.
Implemented articles
Implemented a basic dynamic home page which parses the articles and shows the first paragraph and picture
Implemented a dynamic Categories and Archive page
