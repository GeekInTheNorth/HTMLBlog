# iPads, Surfaces and Tablets! Oh My!

Published: May 22, 2014

At the back end of 2011, I made the leap from having a netbook to entering the tablet market when I bought an iPad 2.  At the time I was  pretty much the only person running around our offices with a tablet.  I instantly enjoyed the experience of having a tablet, but over the following year I started to get really tired of just how much control I didn't have while using the iPad.  Being a technical person using a closed system I often felt constrained, it was impossible to see where my files resided and it was really hard to do any form of file sharing between apps.  In short, it was a very good consumer device, but that's where I felt it ended.

When Microsoft started on the release path for the Surface RT and Surface Pro, the concept of having a tablet that I could be fully productive on and have full control over was exciting.  I spent a lot of time thinking about whether to go for the RT version or the full Pro version.  In the end I opted for the 64GB Surface RT and I sold on my iPad 2 for enough money to mitigate 60% of the cost.

I was happy with what I got, I enjoyed using the Surface RT far more than I did the iPad 2.  I liked that the live tiles told me what was new with the app instead of a silly little red circle with a number.  I liked the look of it, it felt modern; and I liked that I could switch to desktop mode and really have some control over my device and files. I used it for all kinds of things beyond the normal day to day use such as:

- Give power point presentations using dual screens.
- Running the daily Scrum for my development team.
- Sharing information on my home TV during table top RP sessions.
- Documents and Spreadsheets and sharing them through the cloud.

I was happy, but not quite happy enough.  I felt like there were some very obvious missed tricks and bad marketing decisions made with the Surface RT which I feel contributed to poor reception of the operating system.

The name of the device was confusing, what did the RT part mean nothing to the lay person?  It should have been marketed as Windows Tablet so that it shared both a common naming style as Windows Phone and so that consumers could decipher the difference more easily.

The confusing name was compounded by the fact you could not install third party desktop apps; actually this isn't true, by using a hack to change one in-memory variable you could run any desktop app compiled in .Net for ARM processors.  This was clearly a missed trick, a whole wealth of .Net Windows Form applications could have been recompiled and sold through the Microsoft store app with a minimal amount of effort.

The single biggest problem for people to jump to their tablets was the distinct lack of availability.  There were no mainstream shops in England for several months where you could actually see and buy one of these devices.  You can't sell something on the high street if it is not in a high street shop!

After 14 months of being happy, I decided I wanted to be happier with my chosen device, and that meant changing devices once more.  This time I thought long and hard about what I wanted, which came down to this: I wanted something small and lightweight that I could develop on that would allow me to install whatever the heck I.  I also wanted to drop to just carrying one device.

I spent a lot of time debating between the Surface Pro 2 and the Macbook Pro 13" with retina display.  Again getting the Surface Pro 2 with 8gb ram was actually really very hard.  It wasn't available in any shop which sold the Surface Pro 2.  Yet at the same time I could walk into any Apple Store, PC World, KCRS or any other tech store and get the Macbook Pro.  The lack of availability of the Surface Pro 2 kept me debating what to buy for a couple of months.

Finally, having decided I needed something that could be both a production machine and a tablet, I shelled out £1138 on a Surface Pro 2 with a purple type cover.  Finally I was happy again.  I started developing on it and ended up very surprised by just how good the device performed.  I could develop on it, I could sit on the sofa and play XCOM : Enemy Unknown in full HD and I could use it as a tablet.

At the beginning of this week I would have highly recommended it to anyone.  It's a brilliant device, it crosses all the boundaries really very well.  I've traded in using and carrying a Surface RT and a 14" Dell Laptop and started carrying a single awesome device, my Surface Pro 2.

Now they've announced the Surface Pro 3 and I've had the Surface Pro 2 for a month ... Dammit!
