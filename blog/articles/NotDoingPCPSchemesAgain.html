            <h1>Why I Won't Get a PCP Scheme Again</h1>

			<p>My previous car was a 2005 Vauxhall Meriva and at the time of purchasing, I decided that I would essentially drive the car until the point where it would cost me as much to keep the car on the road as it would to buy one.  That turned out to be this year.  Back in March 2015, having just purchased a load of furniture, my car decided to have trouble on the motorway.  It set me back &pound;850 to have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_gas_recirculation" class="article-link" target="_blank">EGR Valve</a> replaced and to have the upper manifold cleaned out.  A couple of months later and I had to take the car in to be serviced again.  This time I decided that the &pound;1,400 price tag to keep her on the road was too much.  Just to clarify, I don't treat my cars like crap, she was just old.</p>
			<p>We looked around and we soon found an almost new car that I wanted to get.  It was just 2 years old with only 16,000 on the clock.  I got myself into the mind-set that this car I was going to get was not an investment.  With the exception of the classics, this is essentially true.  Your car will lose it's value with every day and every mile. After speaking with the sales man I settled on getting a PCP based finance plan.</p>
			<p>The gist of this is that you pay for the deprecation of the vehicle.  So if the vehicle is worth &pound;8,000 and after three years and 36,000 miles it will be worth &pound;3,000 then you just pay the $5,000 different, plus a fee.  There is more information about them here: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/how-to/10339529/How-to-understand-PCP-finance-plans.html" class="article-link" target="_Blank">How to Understand PCP Finance Plans</a></p>
			<p>I am now reaching the end of the second month of using my new old car.  I opted for an annual mileage of 12,000 miles thinking that this would be sufficient. In retrospect I am now thinking otherwise.  Here are the problems as I see it.</p>
			<p>The mileage limits take away your freedom.  I am constantly checking how many miles I have done and how many miles I have left until the monthly anniversary of getting the car.  I'm having to think about my budget in terms of miles.  My daily work commute is 25 miles, which leaves me less than my monthly mileage to do things I want to do.  A trip to see both sides of the family wipes out another 100 miles.  A night of dancing wipes out another 30 miles.  Very quickly I end up with no free miles to do any weekend trips!  I shouldn't be feeling that way when I'm paying a load of money each month for a vehicle that is meant to free me in the things I do.  Sure I could have chosen a higher mileage and paid more of the value of the car, but at that point why not just outright buy it?</p>
			<p>The other realisation I had was that at the end of this three year PCP finance plan, I either have to hand the car back and pay for any extra mileage I've done, or I have to pay another 3,000 to keep it.  I essentially will not have any deposit for my next car.</p>
			<p>So bugger that, next time I'll get a car I can afford on a proper loan without all the extra cost mark-ups that come from dealing with third party finance companies.  At least then I will either have the deposit for my future cars or I can choose to keep driving without having any loans after paying it off.</p>
