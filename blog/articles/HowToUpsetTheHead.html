			<h1>How to Upset the Head</h1>
			<p class="published">Published on: May 27, 2015</p>
			<p>I'm been a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Merlin. In each of these Anthony Stewart Head gave a great performance with quite contrasting characters.  When it came to watching Dominion, I was looking forward to seeing his performance. On seeing it, my first thought was that he had been dubbed, the second thought was why the heck would you take someone whose voice brings distinction and character and have them use a bland American accent? I gave up on Dominion after five episodes, but it had nothing to do with his performance.</p>
			<p>I went to the Sheffield Film and Comic-Con with my best mate Ted and my Fianc√©e Caz.  We'd all bought early access tickets so that we could meet our heroes without waiting in long queues. I stood in the queue for Anthony Stewart head and watched each person before me get a handshake and a hug.  Caz turns to me and asks me if I'm going to say what I thought about him in Dominion and I said that we absolutely would not talk about Dominion and that it would be bad to share my opinions on it.</p>
			<p>When it was finally my turn, I was getting enthused talking about how I liked his performances in Buffy, Merlin and Doctor Who and how he really brought the characters to life and all was well, I was pretty much guaranteed a handshake and maybe even a man-hug.</p>
			<p>And that's when Caz piped up "You know he really hates your accent in dominion".  I performed a mental face-palm as I watched Anthony Stewart Head stop writing on the autograph photo and sit back in his chair with a disapproving look.  I tried unsuccessfully to recover the conversation and left without a hand-shake or a man-hug and a promise that I would indeed try the next couple of episodes of Dominion as requested by Antony Stewart Head.</p>
			<p>Caz later paid for a photo with the man himself, after queueing for a while she was greeted with a "Oh! it's you!".  She still got the hug and the picture.</p>
