            <h1>Lego Doctor Who</h1>

            <p>I haven't owned any Lego in very long time, but every time I walked past the Lego store in the Leeds Trinity Center I was tempted by a number of sets.  The single biggest thing that put me off was the price tag attached to any set that belonged to a different IP.</p>
            <p>This month my wife decided to buy me a gift for being a good husband and it turned out to be the Doctor Who Tadris Lego set that I had been tempted buy so many times.  With a &pound;50 price tag I had talked myself out of buying it before.</p>
            <p>I set about building this in the living room on a Sunday afternoon and it ended up taking me 3:30 hours to follow all 121 pages of instructions to build it.  The complexity and detail of the set were very surprising, whoever designed this did a bang up job.  Here are some pictures of different stages of the build.</p>
