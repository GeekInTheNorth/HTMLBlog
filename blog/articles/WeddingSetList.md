# Wedding Memories : Our Set List

Published: Dec 28, 2015

While going to Wedding Fairs, we saw a couple of groups who specialised in background wedding music to be played during the Wedding Breakfast. While some of these were really good, we didn't want to hire them.  Budget aside, we wanted our wedding to reflect our passions and personalities, not just in the visual theme, but also in the musical theme.

Knowing we had access to the kit belonging to the venue's resident DJ, we chose to make our own playlist.  This turned out to be harder than we imagined and in the end we produced a set list of 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it easily took us three to four times that to sort it out. Along the way we discarded songs for many reasons, not being significant to us, having lyrics that are too negative or being just too over the top.

Each track holds some meaning for us, some are from musicals we've seen together, some are tracks we always dance to, some reflect our tastes and passions and some we just out and out love. In some cases we even found alternate versions of a of song to make things more interesting. Our Set List was a labour of our love.

## Wedding Ceremony

A Thousand Years was played as the Processional song as the bride walked down the isle.  Love Story Meets Love Story was played during the signing of the Register, at just over 6 minutes long it was long enough to cover all of that. Finally, Shut Up and Dance was played as the Recessional Song as we walked back down the isle together with the family in tow.

## Wedding Breakfast - Disc 2

## The First Dance

Occasionally I like to send my wife lyrics to songs that I really enjoy, or that I find make me think about her. The song we chose for our first dance was one such song, however the version we danced to was an alternative version. A duet between the original artist and my favourite violinist.  It's not available to purchase anywhere, but it is on YouTube.  We had thought our DJ would struggle to get a hold of it, turns out he just downloaded it and stripped out the video.
