# Wedding Memories : Comment Slips

Published:Â Dec 27, 2015

For our wedding, we didn't want to get a standard Wedding Guest Book.  We wanted something that could be placed upon our wall as a memento of the day.  So we purchased a wedding heart frame, the idea being that each person would sign a heart and post it into our frame.  It was later that we decided to create a set of comment slips so that we could make a scrap book of memories.  The following is the collection of completed comment slips that we received:
